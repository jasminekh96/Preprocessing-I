        <div class="Intro">
          <p> I am a magna cum laude graduate from CUNY City College of New York (CCNY), where I received a BA in
            Cultural
            Anthropology. My background in the study of cultures, foreign policy, mental health, and Full Stack Web
            Development make me a viable employee. I am passionate about accessibility in the world of technology and
            this
            passion is what led me to study Full Stack Web Development at Lambda School. </p>
